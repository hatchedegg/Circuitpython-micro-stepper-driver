# Circuitpython-micro-stepper-driver
This repository is about a stepper motor driver in Circuit Python. 

Available drivers only make simple movement possible, in full step mode. To use microstepping, the available library, sample code and tutorial are not leading to actual microstepping movement. I am trying to find the problem and get to a microstepping motion for my project.

If I get the available stuff working, it is only for running a motor in a certain direction for a certain amount of steps. For proper motor control, speed, acceleration, deceleration and stepsize are all parameters that should be available to the user. I want to create a driver that will make a smooth movement between points, with acceleration and deceleration to prevent step loss.

Currently this is in the state of gathering information and learning Circuit Python. This is my first repository, therefore it is also my learning subject regarding GitHub.
