# Circuitpython-micro-stepper-driver
This repository is about a stepper motor driver in Circuit Python. Available drivers only make simple movement possible. I want to create a driver that will make a smooth movement between points, with acceleration and deceleration to prevent step loss. Currently this is in the state of gathering information and learning Circuit Python.
